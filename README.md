# chatbot
A chatbot that will help with work. starting with homework and other questions and then moving on to more advanced things.

# Uses
This chatbot is suppose to help with homework problems and from there move on to other problems as we increase its uses.

# How is this an AI?
Well. This is an AI because it learns... its really a mock AI because users teach it everything it learns.

## How does it learn?
It learns by users asking questions and if the answer is in the system it will output it but if its not you can either report the question has no answer and staff will try to answer it with in a week or the user can post the valid answer.

## How do you know that input is correct?
We dont; however, we make sure all answers are related to the question to the best of our ability. It also doesnt accept swear words or phrases that are hateful in any way. from slag to normal... just none will be allowed. (For more list will be postes later)

# WARNING
This bot is trained by users so if an answer is incorrect it is not on the makers of this program. While we do our best to verify answers are not completely wrong, we do not promise anything.
